## models

### Provider
  
The provider is ultimately responsible for all function calls within the business logic.
It generally includes (but is not limited to) two types of **processing procedure**.

In order to make a specific provider that actually supports a business scenario,
A class who is inherit the 'Provider' class and implement **Provide's interfaces** should be provided.

Those implementations is aimed at provide the concrete usages to a **remote service**.

#### Processing procedure

there are two kinds of Processing procedure:

- hset: set an key-value pair of a scope
- receipt: include three method corresponding to three phases of transactions.
    - hookPrepare
    - commit
    - abort

#### Provide's interfaces

FontEnd

- eosplayer.transcal
- eosplayer.sign
- eosplayer.call
- eosplayer.logout
- eosplayer.login
- eosplayer.getBalance
- eosplayer.chain.checkTableItem
- eosplayer.chain.checkTable
- eosplayer.setNetConf
- eosplayer.switchNetwork

BackEnd

- checkTableItem
- validateSign
- giftcode
- call tradeuni
- call confirm
- call ctconfirm

#### Remote Service

##### FontEnd

- set operations
    - createReceipt .ex.(receiptId, quantity)
    - charge .ex.(userIdentity, quantity)

##### Both

- get operations
    - balance(userIdentity)
    > check balance of the userIdentity  
    response should be the value string of user's balance  
    `{ "result": QUANTITY_NUMBER }`
    - scopes()
    > get all scopes in the service  
    response should be a list of all scopes  
    `{ "result": [ ... ] }`
    - hkeys(scope)
    > get all keys of a scope in the service  
    response should be a list of all keys in the scope  
    `{ "result": [ ... ] }`
    - hexist(scope, key)
    > check is the key are provided in the scope  
    response should indicates whether the key is exist  
    `{ "result": true/false }`
    - hget(scope, key)
    > get a value by given scope and key  
    response should be the value of given scope and key  
    `{ "result": VAL }`
    - hgetall(scope)
    > get a key-value pairs by given scope  
    response should be a map of all key-value pairs in the scope  
    `{ "result": { KEY: VAL, ... } }`
    
- set operations
    - hdel(scope, key)
    - transfer(from, to, quantity, memo)
    

##### BackEnd

- get operations
    - validateSign : (login)
- set operations
    - hset(scope, key, val)
    - commitReceipt()
    - abortReceipt
